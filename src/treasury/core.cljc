  ledger entries (ADR-2607051621). Extracted from gftdcojp/local-murakumo's
  itonami.cljc: pricing/units (credits-per-usd, plans, verticals, protocol-fee
  rate, …) stay in the consuming project and are injected as `fee-frac`; this
  namespace only knows USD, USDC, EVM chains, and a signed append-only run

  No custody: a payer sends USDC from their OWN wallet to a treasury address
  supplied by the caller (typically a Safe/multisig) — this library never
  holds keys or moves funds. A payment produces a ledger entry only AFTER

;; USDC contract + block-explorer API per EVM chain.
;;
;; ⚠ DO NOT ASSUME A SAFE EXISTS ON A CHAIN JUST BECAUSE ITS ADDRESS IS FREE
;; THERE. This comment used to say a Safe's address is the same across chains
;; (CREATE2), so switching `chain` moved the rail to a cheaper L2 without
;; changing the recipient. The first half is often true and the CONCLUSION IS
;; DANGEROUS: a Safe is a CONTRACT, deployed per chain. The address being
;; unoccupied elsewhere does not mean a Safe is deployed there, and USDC sent to
;; an address with no code is not recoverable by anyone.
;;
;; Measured 2026-07-26 on a real Safe (0x640404B5…A881): deployed on Ethereum
;; mainnet (v1.4.1), and `eth_getCode` returns EMPTY on BSC, Avalanche, Base,
;; Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism. Routing that recipient to an L2 on the strength
;; of the old comment would have burned the funds.
;;
;; So `verify-recipient-deployed` below must pass before a treasury address is used
;; on a chain it has not already received on.

;;
;; com-junkawasaki/root ADR-2608010000. `receipt->onchain` answers ONE question
;; by asking a chain node about ONE transaction; every verification is a live
;; dependency on an RPC endpoint. That dependency failed in production
;; 2026-08-01 (Cloudflare egress rate-limited by every public Base RPC) and the
;; failure was reported to the payer as "your transaction does not exist".
;;
;; The alternative is not to hold the chain — full Base archive grows ~500 GB
;; per week, which is unbounded. It is to hold a VIEW: the confirmed USDC
;; Transfers into addresses we actually watch. That is bounded by our own
;; payment count, not by chain activity, and it is derived from LOGS rather
;; than state, which is the cheap half of a node's job.
;;
;; The view is content-addressed and therefore memoizable forever: a view over
;; a fixed block range never changes, so a digest of it is a stable key and
;; there is no invalidation path to get wrong (ADR-2607310900's property).
;;
;; THE INVARIANT THAT MATTERS MOST: a view knows a block RANGE, and a question
;; about a transaction outside that range is :not-covered — NEVER :not-found.
;; Collapsing those is the same defect class already fixed once on this path
;; (an RPC failure reported as :tx-not-found), and it is worse here, because a
;; view is by construction incomplete.

   Only logs on the chain's REAL USDC contract and carrying the canonical
   Transfer topic are admitted, so a worthless token whose symbol happens to be
   \"USDC\" contributes nothing — the same reasoning `verify-payment`'s :asset
   check exists for, applied at ingest instead of at decision time."

   `:reason` distinguishes THREE outcomes that must never be collapsed:

     :not-in-view    the view does not contain it — INCONCLUSIVE, ask a node
     :underpaid / :wrong-recipient / :insufficient-confirmations
                     the view has it and it FAILS — conclusive, do not re-ask

   The middle one is the whole point. A view is incomplete by construction, so
   `absent from my index` is not evidence about the chain. Answering
   :tx-not-found there would tell someone who has paid that their payment does
   not exist — the exact production defect this design exists to remove."
